# Blocks

Blocks are repeatable components users can add to a template in any order using the Sites Studio \(or not at all\). 

Each template declares a set of availableBlocks for the user to add in its front-matter. 

At render-time, use the [`{{renderBlock}}`](../helpers/content/renderblock.md) helper in order to select and render the correct block.
