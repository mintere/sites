# Assets

Any file which isn't served as HTML and rendered with Handlebars is an asset. You'll place these in the assets subdirectory. To use them inside of your theme, use the [`{{assetUrl}}`](../helpers/assets/staticfilepath.md) helper. When you deploy your site, we'll take care of uploading these to our global CDN.
