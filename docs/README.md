# Overview

Mintere Sites is the CMS built into the Mintere platform.

Mintere Sites renders themes with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). By precompiling templates and using global infrastructure for deployment, we allow for dynamic server-side rendering while reaching performance competitive with static site hosts. 

Documentation for the Mintere app is available at [https://docs.mintere.com/](https://docs.mintere.com/)
