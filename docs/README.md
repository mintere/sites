description: A birds-eye look at developing with Mintere Sites.

# Overview

Mintere Sites is a hosting platform for globally distributed, super speedy, dynamic marketing websites.

Themes on Mintere Sites are built with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). By precompiling templates and using global infrastructure for deployment, we allow for dynamic server-side rendering while reaching performance competitive with static site hosts. 

We've made the [library we use to render site templates](https://github.com/mintere/sites-renderer) source-available, so you could host it on your own infrastructure. However, when you use our platform, you get the advantages of our extremely fast hosting infrastructure.



Documentation for the Mintere app is available at [https://docs.mintere.com/](https://docs.mintere.com/)
